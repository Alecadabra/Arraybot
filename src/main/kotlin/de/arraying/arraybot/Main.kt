/**
 *
 * EVANESCENCE - BRING ME TO LIFE (2003)
 *
 * How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
 * Leading you down into my core
 * Where I've become so numb,
 * Without a soul
 * My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
 * Until you find it there and lead it back
 * Home
 *
 * Wake me up, wake me up inside, I can't wake up,
 * Wake me up inside, save me,
 * Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
 * Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
 * Before I come undone, save me
 * Save me from the nothing I've become
 *
 * Now that I know what I'm without
 * You can't just leave me
 * Breathe into me and make me real, bring me
 * To life
 *
 * Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,
 * wake me up inside, save me,
 * call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
 * Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
 * Before I come undone, save me
 * Save me from the nothing I've become
 *
 * Bring me to life, I've been living a lie
 * There's nothing inside, bring me to life
 *
 * Frozen inside without your touch
 * Without your love, darling
 * Only you are the life among the dead
 *
 * All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
 * Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
 * I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
 * I've got to open my eyes to everything
 * Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
 * Don't let me die here
 * There must be something wrong, bring me to life
 *
 * Wake me up, wake me up inside, I can't wake up,
 * Wake me up inside, save me,
 * Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
 * Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
 * Before I come undone, save me
 * Save me from the nothing I've become
 *
 * Bring me to life, I've been living a lie,
 * There's nothing inside, (Bring me to life) Bring me to life
