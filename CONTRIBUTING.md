## Coding Standards

* Opening braces are to be placed on the same line, as most common in Java.
* A class definition must contain a copyright header, and have one empty line between the class opening brace and first method, as well as the class closing brace and last method closing brace.
* All methods must be documented. Extremely basic descriptions are sufficient.
* Variables should be named appropriately and not be abbreviated (exception: loop variables such as i, j, etc.).
* On top of this, consistency is perhaps the most important standard.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome, but please ask whether the changes/feature additions are desired first.
When this is not the case the PR may be denied/closed.
If possible, the whole PR will be merged, otherwise only parts will be selected.
